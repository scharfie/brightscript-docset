<h1 id="DesignGuidelines-1.0GuidelinesOverview">1.0 Guidelines Overview</h1>
<p>These guidelines are for developers who want to design and build applications for the Roku streaming player television user interface. The following are the goals of this document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe guidelines to consider as you design applications for television.</li>
<li>Explain the Roku UI model</li>
<li>Define the screen types that are available with the Software Developer Kit (SDK)</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-1.1RokuUIPowerPointTool">1.1 Roku UI PowerPoint Tool</h2>
<p>Roku has developed a PowerPoint Tool that includes wireframes of each Roku screen type. Use this tool to simulate your application before developing code. The tool helps you determine which screens are appropriate for your application, understand the task flow of your application, and verify that your content fits appropriately on each screen. If you prototype with this tool, it's more likely that your application will fit nicely into the general Roku user interface paradigm. The Roku PowerPoint tool is available on the Roku Developer website.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-1.2PerformanceIssues">1.2 Performance Issues</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>You should do all that you can to insure your application runs quickly and is responsive to user input. Ideally users should see visual feedback within 250 milliseconds of pressing a button on the remote control. Visual feedback might include displaying a new screen or moving the focus between objects on the current screen. If your application does have a perceptible delay, make sure to use the progress indicator to keep the user informed about the status of your application and assure them the player is still functioning appropriately. <br><br> Some things you can to make your application feel responsive are to display the screen first then fill the screen with data coming from a network feed secondly. Or, you can display a placeholder or "facade" screen temporarily over the real screen while the data from the feed populates the real screen. After the data is loaded, remove the placeholder screen. This technique is used in applications to avoid flashing the channel menu screen while data is loading from the network.</p>
<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-1.3TelevisionDesignGuidelines">1.3 Television Design Guidelines</h2>
<p>When you design and build an application for television, consider these guidelines.</p>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-1.3.1Format">1.3.1 Format</h4>
<p>The Roku player supports both standard-definition (SD) and high-definition (HD) television formats. In general, although not entirely accurate, SD corresponds with the "traditional" CRT tube-based TV, and HD corresponds with the modern flat screen TV popular with consumers after about 2005. These formats are defined as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The SD source format is 720x480, 4:3 aspect ratio. It is also known as "480i." When the image is output to a display (TV), the image is compressed horizontally to 640x480. To accommodate for this and to avoid distorted images, source art should be created with a "0.9" non-square pixel aspect ratio. This setting is available in design tools like Adobe Photoshop and may be referred to as "D1/DV NTSC (0.9)."</li>
<li>The HD source format is 1280x720, 16:9 aspect ratio. It is also known as "720p." HD pixels are "square" and do not require special consideration as described above for SD.</li>
</ul>
<p><br class="atl-forced-newline"> Design your application to work in both 4:3 and 16:9 formats. Users select their display aspect format through Roku settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help you determine which screens to use to construct your application.</li>
<li>Provide tips to ensure your application is consistent with the Roku look and feel.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-1.3.2Safezones">1.3.2 Safe zones</h4>
<p>Safe zone is a term used to describe the areas of the television picture that can reliably be seen on all types of television screens. Historically, the edges of TV images were distorted by the physical limitations of the glass picture tube.  It was decided that the picture would be overscanned with the edge of the picture hidden by a plastic trim piece on the front of the TV set.  Be aware that the edges of your artwork will not be visible on a TV, even though the entire image is displayed on the computer. Most relevant to SD, this overscan issue also impacts HD. <br class="atl-forced-newline"> Keep text that you intend the audience to read within the Title Safe Zone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The HD Title Safe Zone is 1022X578, offset from the upper left corner (0,0) by 128,70.</li>
<li>The SD Title Safe Zone is 576X384, offset from the upper left corner (0,0) by 72,48.</li>
</ul>
<p><br class="atl-forced-newline"> Keep important visual elements within the Action Safe Zone, content outside the Action Safe Zone risks being cut off by the edge of the screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>The HD Action safe zone is 1150X646, offset from the upper left corner (0,0) by 64,35.</li>
<li>The SD Action safe zone is 648X432, offset from the upper left corner (0,0) by 36,24.</li>
</ul>
<p><br class="atl-forced-newline"> The Roku PowerPoint Screen Template Tool includes safe zones. Use this tool to prototype your application and help determine how much content can reliably fit on the screen.</p>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-1.3.3Pixelelementsandlinewidth">1.3.3 Pixel elements and line width</h4>
<p>Make sure lines are at least 2 pixels wide, and do not use fine detail or single pixel elements on your screens. Avoid bordering areas of high contrast colors. This avoids screen flicker that occurs with interlaced displays, which render TV images alternating odd and even scan lines. This occurs predominantly on SD displays.</p>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-1.3.4Color">1.3.4 Color</h4>
<ul>
<li>RGB color values should be between 16 and 235.</li>
<li>Use de-saturated (low saturation) colors to avoid bleeding. High saturation colors might also be called vibrant, hot, intense, bright, loud, etc. Lowering the saturation might also be called toning it down, muting the color, making the color duller.</li>
<li>Cool colors (blues, purples, and grays) tend to perform better and have less bleeding on TVs than warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows).</li>
<li>Avoid putting high-contrast colors next to each other as they might vibrate or flicker.</li>
<li>Preview art on an actual TV. TVs tend to have higher contrast and saturation than computer monitors.</li>
<li>Use high-contrast colors for emphasis and low contrast color elements for secondary or less important information.</li>
<li>Consider the colors in your brand and whether to use them in your application. Matching colors might be beneficial for product identity, but be aware of color limitations on TVs.</li>
<li>Consider color-blind users when you select your color scheme. For example, some color-blind users might not be able to differentiate between red, green, and gray. Differentiate important elements with a second visual element like shape or size in addition to color.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-1.3.5Typography">1.3.5 Typography</h4>
<ul>
<li>A set of Roku system fonts (a collection of Gotham fonts) is provided through the SDK.</li>
<li>Use a font color that is legible and has enough contrast to be seen against the background.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-1.3.6Visualclarity">1.3.6 Visual clarity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build test screens using the SDK.</li>
<li>Try your screens on both SD and HD resolutions and on small and large screen monitors.</li>
<li>Although HD monitors allow for lots of information to be displayed on the screen simultaneously, design your screens so that they are legible and do not overwhelm the viewer.</li>
<li>Try viewing your screen in direct sunlight and in a darkened room. If there is not enough contrast on your screen, it will appear washed out in direct sunlight. If there is too much contrast on your screen, it might appear too bright in a darkened room.</li>
<li>Check that you can easily see the focus (highlight) so that users can select an item on the screen.</li>
<li>Ask a variety of users to test the screens for legibility.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="DesignGuidelines-2.0RokuUserInterfaceModel">2.0 Roku User Interface Model</h1>
<p>This section describes how to accomplish common user tasks through the Roku UI using the remote control and how the Roku UI is structured.</p>
<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-2.1RokuRemoteControl">2.1 Roku Remote Control</h2>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-2.1.1Navigatingwithinthesystemuserinterface">2.1.1 Navigating within the system user interface</h4>
<p>The UI is controlled by the Roku remote control, which has the following buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="300" width="268" src="https://sdkdocs.roku.com/download/attachments/1611565/worddav44121178384115f6dcefe04426f25acf.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1365202067000&amp;api=v2" data-image-src="/download/attachments/1611565/worddav44121178384115f6dcefe04426f25acf.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1365202067000&amp;api=v2" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1606661" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav44121178384115f6dcefe04426f25acf.png" data-base-url="https://sdkdocs.roku.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="application/octet-stream" data-linked-resource-container-id="1611565" data-linked-resource-container-version="6"></span> Home (the button with the house icon) returns to the Roku home screen.</li>
<li>Up, Down, Right, and Left arrows move the focus (highlight) through the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a details page is displayed, Right and Left buttons navigate forward and backward respectively between content items in the current list. This behavior is controlled by the application, and Roku strongly recommends this behavior. See the developer documents for guidance on how to incorporate this behavior into your application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select, selects the item that has the focus.</li>
<li>Forward scan, when a poster list is on screen, will page forward through the list.</li>
<li>Reverse scan, when a poster list is on screen, will page backward through the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can navigate up the UI hierarchy in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Home to go directly to the Roku home screen.</li>
<li>Press Up. Up will navigate up through selectable items on the screen. After passing through all of the selectable items, Up will return to the previously viewed screen.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="DesignGuidelines-SinceFirmwareversion2.7:">Since Firmware version 2.7:</h6>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>With the new HD model, the remote has the same functionality as the Classic (pictured above) remote but with a new form factor (pictured below left).</li>
<li>The new XD and XDS remotes have three new buttons, the<ul>
<li>
<strong>Instant replay button</strong>. (The button labeled "Skip Back" in the picture below right). Upon pressing this button, the video will skip back 7 seconds without re-buffering. Active only in video mode.</li>
<li>
<strong>Info button</strong>. (The button labeled "Options" in the picture below right). This button must be programmed by app developers, or it will do nothing. App developers should provide contextually relevant information overlaid on video or other UI.</li>
<li>
<strong>Back button</strong>. App developers must enable this button functionality. When enabled, it closes the current screen pops the display stack in the UI. Active only in non-video mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-2.2TypicalBrowseContentFlow">2.2 Typical Browse Content Flow</h2>
<p><br class="atl-forced-newline"> The following is the typical screen flow through an application for browsing content tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roku home screen: All channel applications are listed on and accessible through the Roku home screen. Select a channel (for example, "AcmeCo Video On Demand Channel").</li>
<li>Channel Menu screen: The channel menu screen is displayed. If possible, expose content at the highest level of your application; consider using a list screen [In SDK: <a href="roPosterScreen.html">roPosterScreen</a>] here. If your application and content requires multiple levels of categorization, consider using a category screen as a menu at this level. Choose a channel (for example, "TV On Demand").</li>
<li>List screen: A content list is displayed. If the content has images, a poster list screen is displayed, [In SDK: <a href="roPosterScreen.html">roPosterScreen</a>]. If the content is categorized, an optional filter banner is displayed so the user can select a category (for example "Top TV Shows") before selecting content ("Grey's Anatomy, Season 5").</li>
<li>Episodic picker screen (for episodic content only): If the selected content has episodes, an episodic picker screen is displayed so the user can choose an episode (for example, "Episode 12, Stairway To Heaven"). If the content does not have episodes, the episodic picker is not displayed.[In SDK: <a href="roPosterScreen.html">roPosterScreen (flat-episodic)</a>].</li>
<li>Details screen: After selecting content from a list or episodic picker, the content details screen is displayed. Select the Play button on the detail screen to start playing content. [In SDK: <a href="roSpringboardScreen.html">roSpringboard</a>]</li>
<li>Content playback: The show begins to play. Press the Up button on the remote to stop content playback and return to the Details screen. If bookmarks are enabled on the Roku Streaming Player or server, exiting content will pause the video and place a bookmark so that the user can resume play later. If not, the user will have to start content playback from the beginning the next time they attempt to play. Use bookmarks if possible. Press Home to return to the Roku home screen.</li>

If your application supports predictive search, the results list begins to populate as users enter text. If not, an empty list results list or search history could be presented initially. After entering text, the user selects a search result from the list on the right side of the screen.</li>
<li>Content List: If the content selected from the result list in the keyboard has more than a single result a content list is presented. If a single result is obtained, the content list can be skipped.</li>
<li>Episodic Content: If the selected content has episodes, an Episodic Picker screen should be used so the user can select a single episode. If not this step can be skipped. [In SDK: <a href="roPosterScreen.html">roPosterScreen </a>(flat-episodic)]</li>
<li>Details Screen: Once a single piece of content is selected, a details screen is presented. The action button for initiating content playback is typically on the details screen. [In SDK: <a href="roSpringboardScreen.html">roSpringboardScreen</a>]</li>
<li>Content playback: The content fills the screen. The transport controls display temporarily, then time out. [In SDK: <a href="roVideoScreen.html">roVideoScreen</a>]<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-2.4TypicalApplicationLinkingFlow">2.4 Typical Application Linking Flow</h2>
<p>Roku users discover and add channels to their Roku streaming player via the Roku Channel Store. Once added, channels appear on the user's Roku Home screen. Channel applications can run on the Roku streaming player in either an "unlinked" or "linked" state. Channels that are not linked enable all users who have added your Channel to their home screen equal access to the content that you provide. Linking enables personalization and allows users to associate their Roku streaming player with their personal accounts on your website. This limits content access based on their account status. In order for users to access personal content, they must link their Roku streaming player to their active account on your website.<br> The choice whether to have users link their Roku streaming player to their active web account is entirely up to the channel partner. For instance, with Netflix, users must link before they can browse content because a Netflix user account is necessary to view an Instant Queue. Amazon allows users to browse content prior to linking because Amazon wants to enable users to shop before playing content. In that case, Amazon facilitates trial of the application and ultimately inspires users to create an account and link before content playback. Some channels may provide a hybrid solution-enabling users to browse content that is available to all users when not "signed in", but requiring linking to view personal content.</p>

<li>The <strong>overhang</strong> is the application-branded area at the top of each screen (objects in the overhang are inactive and cannot be selected by the user). The suggested maximum Overhang height is 83 pixels for SD and 124 pixels for HD. The enforced maximum Overhang height is 92 for SD and 138 for HD. Between the suggested maximum height and the enforced maximum height is a transition area in which application developers should alpha blend their Overhang art into the screen background. Art rendered in the Overhang transition area (83 - 92 px for SD and 124 - 138 px for HD) will be rendered over by the Filter Banner, Modal Dialogs, and other native UI widgets. Application developers should not assume that the art in the Overhang transition zone will always be viewable by the end user. [In SDK: <a href="roAppManager.html">OverhangSlice</a>]</li>
<li>The <strong>primary logo</strong> is your application logo. [In SDK: <a href="roAppManager.html">OverhangLogo + OverhangLogoOffset</a>]</li>
<li>The <strong>breadcrumb</strong> is a two-level pathname (the current screen and the previous level in the application hierarchy) that updates dynamically as the user traverses the system. [BreadcrumbTextLeft, BreadcrumbTextRight]</li>

<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-3.1RokuUIBehavior">3.1 Roku UI Behavior</h2>
<p>The Roku UI utilizes a horizontal list-scrolling mechanism on category screens, filter banners, and poster list screens. This behavior appears throughout the UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus: Default focus is on the first item in the list. In the default state, the first list item is usually centered on the screen. Focus (highlight) remains in the centered position as the list is traversed horizontally. The centered position is usually larger than the items to the left and right of center.</li>
<li>Up: Checks if a selectable object exists above. If yes, moves focus to the object above. If no, returns to the previously viewed screen.</li>
<li>Down: Checks if a selectable object exists below. If yes, moves focus to the object below. If no, does nothing, and plays the error sound, the audio cue that an action is not possible.</li>
<li>Left: Checks if a selectable item exists to the left. If yes, the items to the left move one position right. If no selectable item exists to the left and selectable items exist to the right, moves focus to the last item in the list. If no selectable item exists to the left or right, does nothing, and plays the error sound.</li>
<li>Right: Checks if a selectable item exists to the right. If yes, the items to the right move one position left. If no selectable item exists to the right and selectable items exist to the left, moves focus to the first item in the list. If no selectable items exist to the right or left, does nothing, and plays the error sound.</li>
<li>Select: Selects the item that has focus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2RokuUIGlobalCustomizationOptions">3.2 Roku UI Global Customization Options</h2>
<p>This section describes the Roku UI attributes that are applied globally throughout the application when you change these option settings. Unless otherwise noted, the following global customization options appear on all screens in an application. Detailed information about customization can be found in the technical document: <em>Component Reference.</em></p>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2.1Screenbackgroundorcontentregion">3.2.1 Screen background or content region</h4>
<p>A single RGB value is used to define the rectangular background that fills the content area of the screen. Typically backgrounds contrast with the text that sits on top. For example, if the background is light (RGB: 192, 192, 192) then the text that is applied on top should be dark (RGB: 43, 43, 43).</p>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2.2Overhang">3.2.2 Overhang</h4>
<ul>
<li>Appears on all screens within an application.</li>
<li>A "slice" or small bitmap image can be repeated horizontally to fill the overhang area and create the background of the overhang. Alternatively, a single bitmap image can fill the overhang space.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2.3Primaryapplicationlogo">3.2.3 Primary application logo</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your application logo should appear in the upper left corner of the overhang of all screens in your application.</li>
<li>Make certain that the logo is sized and located similarly to the Roku logo to ensure consistency of logo placement throughout the Roku user experience.</li>
<li>Make sure the logo falls within the TV safe area.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2.4Breadcrumb">3.2.4 Breadcrumb</h4>
<p>The breadcrumb informs the user about their current position within an application.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should appear on all screens except the top most screen within a channel.</li>
<li>The second level screen should display one breadcrumb, indicating that the user has passed through the first level.</li>
<li>All screens below the 2<sup>nd</sup> level should display a two-level breadcrumb. The right most breadcrumb indicates the current level, the left most breadcrumb indicates the level above.</li>
<li>Two font colors are used in the breadcrumb to differentiate between the previous and current levels. The current level should be the easiest to read and have the most contrast against the overhang background. The previous level should be subdued and have a lower contrast value against the overhang background.</li>
<li>The breadcrumb should remain constant as the user traverses content within a level. To test this, try navigating left and right within a filter on a content list screen. The breadcrumb should not change.</li>
<li>Often a filter name appears in the left most position of a breadcrumb on the 3<sup>rd</sup> level screens. For example: If the user has navigated into TV content and is browsing through comedy the breadcrumb at the 3<sup>rd</sup> level might say: "Comedy / 30 Rock".</li>
<li>Position: Upper right corner of the overhang.</li>
<li>Font type, size, and placement: Predetermined by the SDK.</li>
<li>Font color: Customizable by the developer.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2.5Optionalfilterbannerforlistscreens">3.2.5 Optional filter banner for list screens</h4>
<p>If your application supports content categorization, an optional filter banner can be used. The filter banner allows the user to select a category before selecting content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Position: Under the overhang and above content on list screens.</li>
<li>Font type, size, and placement: Predetermined by the SDK.</li>
<li>Font color: Customizable by the developer.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2.6Focustextforlistscreensandepisodepickerscreens">3.2.6 Focus text for list screens and episode picker screens</h4>
<p>The content in focus can be described with two strings of focus text. The primary focus text field is usually a title or the text that describes the object in focus. The secondary text field is supporting text, for example, the price of the content in focus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the vertical spacing of elements on your screen. In some cases the second line of text may get tight. Consider omitting the second line of text in these cases.</li>
<li>Font type, size, and placement: Predetermined by the SDK.</li>
<li>Font color: Customizable by the developer.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="DesignGuidelines-3.2.7Detailsscreentext">3.2.7 Details screen text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Font type, size, and placement: Predetermined by the SDK.</li>
<li>Font color: Customizable by the developer except, inactive text elements (objects that do not behave as buttons) and text that is part of an image.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h1 id="DesignGuidelines-4.0RokuScreenTypes">4.0 Roku Screen Types</h1>
<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-4.1CategoryScreen">4.1 Category Screen</h2>
<p>Use a category screen [roPosterScreen flat-category in SDK] when your application needs a menu to display a list of features or your content requires more than two levels of categorization. Generally, the application features or categories are represented with icons that can be selected to navigate to content collections, search, or settings. List screens are preferred to category screens because they contain content posters rather than icons. If possible, use list screens. Category screens are optional in your application. The Category Screen will also support an ad "Site Stripe" below the menu items. <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Tip:</strong> Don't confuse the category screen with the Poster List Screen; they have a similar look and feel. See the Poster Screen section in this document for details. <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Category Screen Components and Behaviors</strong><br> <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="285" width="600" src="https://sdkdocs.roku.com/download/attachments/1611565/worddavd470cce2dc7275d5eda72acf15aabeaf.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1365202067000&amp;api=v2" data-image-src="/download/attachments/1611565/worddavd470cce2dc7275d5eda72acf15aabeaf.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1365202067000&amp;api=v2" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1606666" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddavd470cce2dc7275d5eda72acf15aabeaf.png" data-base-url="https://sdkdocs.roku.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="application/octet-stream" data-linked-resource-container-id="1611565" data-linked-resource-container-version="6"></span></p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>overhang</strong> is a component of all screens. For more information, see the Roku UI Global Customization Options in this document.</li>
<li>The <strong>optional filter banner</strong> allows users to select a category before selecting content within a category.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If your content is grouped by categories, an optional filter banner can be used on your list screen. Examples of filters are content types (action, comedy, drama), merchandising lists (HD movies, top rentals, new releases), days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), etc. Details on how to populate the filter banner are included in the ComponentReference document. </li>
<li>Filter banner focus: By default, focus is on the first category centered in the filter banner. Initially, there should be no filters to the left of focus. Subsequent filter categories are displayed on the right. When a user scrolls the filter banner horizontally, up to three filter categories can be viewed simultaneously, one on either side of the center focus.<ul>
<li>Press Up, return to the previously viewed screen; focus on the item selected to navigate to this screen.</li>
<li>Press Down, move focus to the center poster in the content region.</li>
<li>Press Left,<ul>

<li>The posters below the filter banner are items from the category in focus and are grayed out when the filter banner is in focus. When focus moves down to the posters from the banner, the filter banner grays out, indicating that the posters are now active.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Poster list items</strong> are displayed in a horizontal V-shaped list. The posters in the list appear to get smaller the farther they get from the poster in focus. Posters are displayed in the most relevant sort order. For example, if the filter is "recent," the first poster is the newest item in the list. By default, the first list item is in center focus, followed by additional posters to the right of center.</li>
<li>
<strong>Poster focus</strong>by default is pinned on the center poster in the bottom of the "V" in the content region.<ul><li><ul>
<li>Press Up, and the system checks if there is a filter banner<ul>
<li>If yes, move focus to the filter banner; focus on the filter selected previously.</li>

<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-4.3EpisodicPickerScreen">4.3 Episodic Picker Screen</h2>
<p>Use an episodic picker screen when users need to browse episodic content. If the content selected is grouped by episode (for example, Season 3 of the series "House"), the episodic picker allows users to select a single episode from the season. Typically, episodic content has a single poster image for the entire episodic group. Use the episodic picker rather than a list screen because it confines episode selection to a lower level and avoids having to display the same poster multiple times on one screen.<br> The SDK offers two types of episodic picker screens. Choose the type that is appropriate for your content:</p>
<ul>
<li>4:3 Episodic Picker supports artwork in the 4:3 aspect ratio (TV, user-created content). [In SDK: flat-episodic]</li>

<h2 id="DesignGuidelines-4.10Dialogs">4.10 Dialogs</h2>
<p>Dialogs are secondary windows that appear above application screens. They allow users to perform a command, engage in a dialog with the application, or simply provide system progress feedback when the application is busy. There are two basic types of dialogs in the Roku system: an interactive dialog that requires user feedback before proceeding with the current task and a progress indicator that informs the user about a system delay but allows no user input. <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Dialog Components and Behaviors</strong> <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="269" width="480" src="https://sdkdocs.roku.com/download/attachments/1611565/worddav6cda76c882d963121c8f0f7daa515fef.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1365202066000&amp;api=v2" data-image-src="/download/attachments/1611565/worddav6cda76c882d963121c8f0f7daa515fef.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1365202066000&amp;api=v2" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="1606640" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav6cda76c882d963121c8f0f7daa515fef.png" data-base-url="https://sdkdocs.roku.com" data-linked-resource-content-type="application/octet-stream" data-linked-resource-container-id="1611565" data-linked-resource-container-version="6"></span><br>Interactive Dialog: <br class="atl-forced-newline"> If you need to inform the user about an event or require feedback from the user before proceeding with a task, use an interactive dialog [In SDK: roMessageDialog].</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>dialog box</strong> is a floating window that appears temporarily over applications.</li>
<li>The <strong>dialog title</strong> identifies the system feature that originated the dialog.</li>
<li>The <strong>dialog prompt</strong> informs the user about why the dialog appeared. The prompt is often stated as a question that is resolved by selecting one of the action buttons included on the dialog. It can also simply inform the user about an event, and the user dismisses the dialog after reading.</li>
<li>
<strong>Action buttons</strong> allow the user to make a selection that dismisses the dialog. The default action should be the top button and, if selected, should have the safest or preferred consequence. We recommend that dialogs contain no more than 3 action buttons. Use the "back" button when the dialog is simply informing the user of an issue or to abort an action.</li>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>dialog box</strong> is a floating window that appears temporarily over applications.</li>
<li>The <strong>dialog title</strong> identifies the system feature that originated the dialog and informs the user about the nature of the delay. If possible, give the user some indication about how long the delay might last.</li>

</ol>
<p><br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Tip:</strong> Progress indicators have no action buttons. They automatically dismiss when the delaying process is complete.<br> <strong>Appendix I: Guidelines for publishing a channel to Roku's Channel Store</strong><br> The process of publishing a channel to Roku's Channel Store includes several steps.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Create a developer account and log in</strong></li></ol>
<p>Adding a channel to Roku's Channel Store requires a Roku developer account. Developers will create a Roku user account and then agree to an SDK License agreement. By creating this account, Roku grants developers full access to the Roku SDK as well as additional resources. Instructions and links to complete this process can be found at <a class="external-link" href="http://roku.com/developer" rel="nofollow">http://roku.com/developer</a>.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Provide metadata</strong></li></ol>
<p>The following information or metadata must be provided when adding a channel: <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Channel Name:</strong> Channel Name is what users will see when browsing the Roku Channel Store. This name should be less than XX characters in order to appear in various places in the Roku player user interface It is generally only one or two words and reflects the core brand and/or functionality of the channel being offered. <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Description:</strong> The description is limited to 250 characters and should provide users with the core feature(s) and benefits of the channel being offered. It should also indicate implications of adding the channel (e.g., "by adding this channel you are agreeing to [provider]'s Terms and Conditions). <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Version:</strong> When uploading your channel on the Roku Developer site, you will be asked to include the version number. The purpose of the version number is to indicate whether an application is newer than a previous version. While updating existing channels is discussed a little later in this document, it is important to note that while the version numbers you provide do not need to be sequential; they do need to be ascending in order for an update to occur. The version number will also be visible to the user in the Channel Store. <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Build numbers:</strong> A build number field is available when uploading a channel. This is not a required field and is never visible to the end-user. Its purpose is to provide developers an option to track specific builds of a particular version. <br class="atl-forced-newline"> <strong>Parental Hints:</strong> The four options provided are intended to give parents a sense of the type of content available on the channel. It is up to each developer to select a hint that they believe is applicable to their content selection. The developer must select one of the following four hints during the process of adding a channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appropriate for all ages.</li>
<li>Content individually rated.</li>
<li>Content not rated.</li>
<li>Inappropriate for children.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Requirements:</strong> In the spirit of full disclosure, Roku recommends indicating here whether or not there are additional requirements beyond adding the channel on Roku to use it. For instance, if a paid subscription is required, this option should be selected and will be displayed to the end-user. The following four requirements options will be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>None</li>
<li>Free Account</li>
<li>Subscription</li>
<li>Additional Fees May Apply</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ol><li><strong>Browse and upload</strong></li></ol>
<p>There will be 3 separate files required to complete you channel addition. The first is a zip file of your channel application. The second and third are called Poster HD and Poster SD and are the HD and SD versions of the home page icon. A sample version of these assets will be available from the <a class="external-link" href="http://roku.com/developer" rel="nofollow">http://roku.com/developer</a> site. These images will be presented to the user along with metadata for your channel in the Channel Store and once the user adds it; will be visible on Roku Home.<br> After all the appropriate files are uploaded and the metadata is entered in the required fields, you will click on a "Submit" button and the channel will enter the next phase of the publishing process.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Confirmation code</strong></li></ol>
<p>During the next phase, your submission will be in an unpublished state and not yet visible in the store. A unique code will be generated for the channel version. This code will appear in a grid on the developer page in the channel grid. You can distribute this code to beta testers via email. For end-users to enter the code, they must go to the following URL: <a class="external-link" href="http://roku.com/channelcode" rel="nofollow">http://roku.com/channelcode</a> and enter the code provided by you and select "add channel". The next time their Roku player synchronizes with the Roku servers, the channel will be added to their home screen.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Final publishing to Channel Store</strong></li></ol>
<p>As a developer, you can upload multiple versions of your channel to Roku without all becoming visible in the store. To publish your channel to the store, you will select "publish" from the grid on the developer site. Publishing a channel updates all prior versions installed on Roku Streaming Players to the published version.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Channel appears in Channel Store at next unit refresh</strong></li></ol>
<p><br class="atl-forced-newline"> The next time a player connects with Roku, new channels will be appear in the Channel Store and available for download.</p>
